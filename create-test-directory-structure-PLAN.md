# Create Test Directory Structure - Plan

## Task Title
Create Test Directory Structure

## Implementation Approach
Create the required test directory structure at the project root, including the `tests/` directory, `tests/common/` subdirectory, and two empty files: `tests/common/mod.rs` and `tests/proxy_integration_tests.rs`. This will establish the foundation for integration tests.
