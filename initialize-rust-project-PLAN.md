# Initialize Rust Project

## Goal
Create a new binary Rust project using `cargo new` for the Switchboard application.

## Implementation Approach
The simplest and most standard approach is to use the Cargo tool directly with the `--bin` flag to create a binary project. This will set up the initial project structure following Rust's standard conventions.

Steps:
1. Initialize Rust project in the current directory using `cargo init --bin`
2. Verify that the basic project structure was created correctly

## Reasoning
Using Cargo's built-in project creation functionality is the most direct and idiomatic way to initialize a Rust project. This approach:

- Follows the standard Rust workflow
- Creates the necessary directory structure automatically
- Initializes a Git repository (unless the `--vcs none` flag is used)
- Creates a basic `Cargo.toml` file with project metadata
- Adds a minimal `main.rs` with a "Hello, world!" example

Alternative approaches like manually creating the directory structure would be more error-prone and deviate unnecessarily from the standard Rust development workflow.
