# Implement setup_test_environment Function Skeleton - Plan

## Task Title
Implement `setup_test_environment` Function Skeleton in `tests/common/mod.rs`

## Implementation Approach
Define an async function `setup_test_environment()` in the `tests/common/mod.rs` file that returns a `TestSetup` instance. Include the necessary import for `std::time::Duration`. The function signature will be established with a skeleton implementation that returns an unimplemented!() for now, as the full implementation will be completed in subsequent tasks.
