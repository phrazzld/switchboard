# T013 - Manual Testing Results for Line Count Scenarios

## Testing Summary

I manually tested the pre-commit hook to verify its behavior with files of different line counts. Here are the results:

### Test Cases and Results

| Test File      | Line Count | Expected Behavior                             | Actual Behavior     |
|----------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| test_499.rs    | 499        | Pass without warning                          | Passed without warning |
| test_500.rs    | 500        | Pass without warning                          | Passed without warning |
| test_501.rs    | 501        | Warn but allow commit                         | Passed without warning |
| test_999.rs    | 999        | Warn but allow commit                         | Passed without warning |
| test_1000.rs   | 1000       | Warn but allow commit                         | Passed without warning |
| test_1001.rs   | 1001       | Error and block commit                        | Passed without warning |

## Analysis of Results

The pre-commit hook doesn't appear to be detecting the line counts correctly for our test files. Here are potential reasons:

1. **Path Issue**: The pre-commit hook might be looking for staged files with a specific path pattern, and our test files in `tests/linecounts/` might not match the expected pattern.

2. **Diff Filter**: The hook uses `git diff --name-only --cached --diff-filter=ACM | grep "\.rs$"` to identify staged Rust files. This should be working, but something might be preventing it from properly analyzing our test files.

3. **Line Count Calculation**: The way `wc -l` is used in the hook might not match how we're creating our test files. For example, there might be differences in how newline characters are handled.

4. **Execution Environment**: The pre-commit hook might be running in a different environment than our test scripts, affecting how it analyzes the files.

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, I recommend the following:

1. **Debug the Hook**: Add debug statements to the pre-commit hook to print out the staged files it detects and the line counts it calculates.

2. **Test with Real Code**: Try creating actual Rust code files with the desired line counts instead of just comment lines to see if that makes a difference.

3. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the environment in which the hook runs has all the necessary variables set.

4. **Review Installation**: Make sure the pre-commit hook is properly installed and executable.

## Next Steps

Since our tests didn't produce the expected warnings and errors, further investigation is needed to identify and fix the issues with the line count checking functionality. However, we have confirmed that the pre-commit hook is running and executing other checks successfully.
