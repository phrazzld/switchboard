# Execute Forwarded Request

## Task
Send the request using the `reqwest::Client` and await the response.

## Implementation Approach
1. Replace the current placeholder response with code to execute the request
2. Call `forward_req_builder.send().await` to send the request to the Anthropic API
3. Capture the result in a variable (`forward_resp_result`)
4. Add appropriate logging to indicate the request has been sent
5. Return a placeholder response until the next task (response handling) is implemented

The implementation will execute the API request but won't handle the response yet (that will be done in the next task).
