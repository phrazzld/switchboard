Okay, let's analyze the task of fixing the underlying doctest failures.

## Root Cause Analysis

1.  **Why were doctests skipped in CI?**
    *   The CI configuration file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) explicitly uses the `--tests` flag in the `test` job: `run: cargo test --all-features --tests`.
    *   The `--tests` flag instructs `cargo test` to run *only* unit and integration tests (found in `src/**` and `tests/**` respectively) and to *skip* documentation tests.
    *   A comment `# Run all tests except doctests, which have a separate issue` confirms this was intentional, likely because the doctests were known to be failing.

2.  **Identify Failing Doctests:**
    *   Running `cargo test --all-features` (without `--tests`) locally reveals the failures.
    *   Based on the provided code:
        *   The doctest for `logger::init_tracing` in `src/logger.rs` calls `config::load_config()`.
        *   `config::load_config()` in `src/config.rs` uses `env::var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY").expect(...)`, which will panic if the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is not set.
        *   Doctests run in isolated environments where this environment variable is typically not set.
        *   Therefore, the `logger::init_tracing` doctest is expected to fail with a panic related to the missing environment variable.
        *   No other doctests are apparent in the provided code snippets (`config.rs`, `lib.rs`, `proxy_handler.rs` - assuming the last has no doctests or they pass).

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Manual `Config` Instantiation in Doctest

*   **Steps:**
    1.  Modify the doctest example in `src/logger.rs`.
    2.  Replace the call to `config::load_config()` with a manually constructed `Config` struct instance. Provide dummy values for its fields.
    3.  Add necessary `use` statements (e.g., `use switchboard::config::Config;`).
    4.  Ensure the example still clearly demonstrates the call to `logger::init_tracing`.
        ```rust
        /// # Example
        /// ```
        /// # use switchboard::config::Config; // Added
        /// # use switchboard::logger;
        /// // In a real app, load config using config::load_config()
        /// // For this example, we create one manually:
        /// let config = Config {
        ///     port: "8080".to_string(),
        ///     anthropic_api_key: "dummy_key_for_test".to_string(),
        ///     anthropic_target_url: "dummy_url".to_string(),
        ///     log_level: "info".to_string(),
        ///     log_format: "pretty".to_string(),
        /// };
        /// logger::init_tracing(&config);
        /// // Note: Tracing initialization affects global state.
        /// // This example primarily shows the function signature and call.
        /// ```
        ```
    5.  Run `cargo test --all-features` locally to verify this doctest and others pass.
    6.  Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to remove the `--tests` flag from the `cargo test` command.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Simple, direct fix targeting the specific failure.
    *   Avoids environment variable dependency within the test context.
    *   Keeps the example focused on the `init_tracing` function call itself.
    *   Requires no changes to production code.
    *   Easy to understand and maintain.

*   **Cons:**
    *   The example code doesn't show the *typical* production path for obtaining `Config` (`load_config`).
    *   `init_tracing` modifies global state (tracing subscriber). While `cargo test` often isolates doctests, running this could potentially interfere with other tests if isolation isn't perfect or if multiple tests try to initialize logging. The `init()` call might fail if a subscriber is already set globally.

*   **Evaluation Against Standards:**
    *   `CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`: Aligns well with **Simplicity**. Improves **Testability** by making the doctest pass. Enhances **Maintainability** of documentation. **Explicit** about the function call.
    *   `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`: Minimal impact. Slightly deviates from showing standard **Config Management** (Guideline 6) in the example, but acceptable for a focused doctest.
    *   `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: Aligns with **Std 12 (Testing)** by fixing a doctest and **Std 9 (Comments)** by ensuring documentation examples are correct and runnable.
    *   `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`: Aligns with **Guiding Principles** (Simplicity). Fixes a **Doc Test**. Avoids complex mocking (**Mocking Policy**). Improves **FIRST** properties (Repeatable, Self-Validating). Acknowledges the potential global state issue related to **Isolation**.
    *   `DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`: Strongly aligns with **Sec 4 (rustdoc)** by ensuring `# Examples` are correct and verifiable via `doctests`.

### Approach 2: Set Environment Variable in Doctest (Hidden)

*   **Steps:**
    1.  Modify the doctest example in `src/logger.rs`.
    2.  Use `std::env::set_var` before calling `load_config` and `std::env::remove_var` afterwards. Hide these lines from the rendered documentation using `#`.
        ```rust
        /// # Example
        /// ```
        /// # use switchboard::config;
        /// # use switchboard::logger;
        /// # // Setup: Need to set the required env var for load_config()
        /// # std::env::set_var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "dummy_key_for_doctest");
        /// let config = config::load_config(); // This now works
        /// logger::init_tracing(config);
        /// # // Teardown: Clean up the env var
        /// # std::env::remove_var("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY");
        /// ```
    3.  Run `cargo test --all-features` locally to verify. This approach is likely to fail or be flaky due to `OnceLock` in `load_config`.
    4.  Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to remove the `--tests` flag.

*   **Pros:**
    *   The visible part of the example (`load_config(); init_tracing(config);`) accurately reflects the typical production code flow.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Highly Problematic:** Modifies global environment state, violating test isolation principles and potentially causing flaky tests, especially with parallel execution.
    *   **`OnceLock` Conflict:** `config::load_config` uses `OnceLock`. If `CONFIG` was already initialized by another test (or even a previous doctest run within the same process if isolation fails), `load_config` will return the previously initialized value, ignoring the `set_var` in this test. This makes the test unreliable and order-dependent. Resetting `OnceLock` is not feasible in a test.
    *   Introduces hidden complexity (`#`) for setup and teardown.
    *   Still has the global state issue with `init_tracing` itself.

*   **Evaluation Against Standards:**
    *   `CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`: Violates **Simplicity** due to hidden complexity and fragility. Harms **Testability** and **Maintainability**. Not **Explicit**.
    *   `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`: Attempts to follow **Config Management** (Guideline 6) but fails due to test environment limitations.
    *   `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: Violates **Std 12 (Testing)** principles regarding isolation.
    *   `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`: Violates **Guiding Principles** (Simplicity, Testability). Violates **Mocking Policy** spirit (manipulating global state instead of mocking). Violates **FIRST** properties (Independent/Isolated, Repeatable/Reliable).
    *   `DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`: While the visible example looks correct (**Sec 4**), the underlying test is fragile and complex, undermining the goal of reliable documentation tests.

### Approach 3: Refactor `load_config` to Return `Result`

*   **Steps:**
    1.  Modify `src/config.rs`: Change `load_config` to return `Result<&'static Config, ConfigError>` (define a suitable `ConfigError` enum, perhaps using `thiserror`). Replace `.expect(...)` with `env::var(...).map_err(|_| ConfigError::MissingApiKey)?`.
    2.  Update the call site(s) of `load_config` (likely in `main.rs`) to handle the `Result`, e.g., log the error and exit gracefully on failure.
    3.  Decide how to handle the `logger.rs` doctest:
        *   *Option 3a (Combine with Approach 1):* Still use manual `Config` instantiation in the logger doctest (simplest for the *logger* example).
        *   *Option 3b (Show Result Handling):* Modify the logger doctest to call `load_config().expect("...")` or handle the `Result`, but this requires setting the env var (Approach 2's problems) or makes the logger example overly complex.
    4.  Add unit tests for `config::load_config` itself to verify its success and error paths.
    5.  Run `cargo test --all-features` locally to verify.
    6.  Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to remove the `--tests` flag.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Improves the robustness and error handling of the production `load_config` function, removing a panic at startup.
    *   Makes `load_config` itself properly unit-testable.
    *   Aligns better with idiomatic Rust error handling (`Result`).

*   **Cons:**
    *   Larger scope change, impacting production code (startup logic) beyond just fixing a doctest.
    *   Doesn't inherently solve the `logger.rs` doctest's need for a `Config` instance any better than Approach 1; a choice (like Option 3a) is still required for that specific doctest.
    *   Adds minor complexity to the application's main entry point.

*   **Evaluation Against Standards:**
    *   `CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`: Improves **Maintainability** and **Explicitness** (error handling). Enhances **Testability** of `load_config`. **Simplicity** is debatable (removes panic, adds `Result` handling).
    *   `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`: Strongly aligns with **Guideline 7 (Error Handling)**.
    *   `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: Aligns with **Std 2 (Type System - Result)** and **Std 12 (Testing)** by making `load_config` testable.
    *   `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`: Improves **Design for Testability** of the config module. Aligns with **Guiding Principles**.
    *   `DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`: Indirect benefit by making core components more robust, but doesn't simplify the *logger doctest fix* itself compared to Approach 1.

## Recommendation

**Approach 1: Manual `Config` Instantiation in Doctest**

*   **Rationale:**
    1.  **Simplicity/Clarity (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`):** This is the most straightforward and least complex way to achieve the primary goal: fix the failing doctest for `logger::init_tracing`. It directly addresses the root cause (missing env var preventing `load_config`) without introducing fragility or major code changes.
    2.  **Separation of Concerns (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`):** The fix is localized to the documentation example, respecting module boundaries.
    3.  **Testability (Minimal Mocking) (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`):** It avoids the problematic global state manipulation of Approach 2 and doesn't require mocking. It directly fixes the doctest failure, improving the reliability (`Repeatable`) of `cargo test`. While the underlying global state issue of `init_tracing` exists, this approach doesn't worsen it and is the most pragmatic fix for the *doctest*. Approach 2 actively violates test isolation. Approach 3 is a worthwhile refactoring but is out of scope for *just* fixing the doctest and doesn't eliminate the need for a solution like Approach 1 within the logger doctest anyway.
    4.  **Coding Conventions (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`):** Directly fulfills Std 12 by leveraging built-in testing (doctests) correctly and Std 9 by ensuring documentation examples are accurate.
    5.  **Documentability (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`):** Directly supports Sec 4 by making the documentation example runnable and verifiable. It clearly shows *how to call `init_tracing`*, which is the main purpose of that specific example.

*   **Conclusion:** Approach 1 is the most focused, lowest-risk, and simplest solution that meets all acceptance criteria for the task. It directly fixes the doctest failure in alignment with project standards, particularly prioritizing simplicity and testability within the context of documentation examples. The CI configuration should then be updated to include doctests in its run.
