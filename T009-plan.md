# T009 Plan - Add `log_dir_mode` field to `Config` struct

## Current Status Analysis

Looking at the task description:
- Add `pub log_dir_mode: LogDirectoryMode` field to the `Config` struct
- Update config loading/parsing logic with default values
- Ensure config loading/parsing works with the new field
- Update unit tests

However, examining `src/config.rs` reveals that a similar field already exists:
- Line 60: `pub log_directory_mode: LogDirectoryMode`
- The config loading code already handles this field (lines 119-125)
- Unit tests for this field already exist (lines 414-470)

## Options

1. **Rename existing field**: Change `log_directory_mode` to `log_dir_mode` for consistency with task description
2. **Update task**: Mark T009 as completed since the functionality already exists with a slightly different name
3. **Add second field**: Add a separate `log_dir_mode` field alongside the existing one (not recommended)

## Decision

Option 2 seems most appropriate. The task's intention has already been implemented with a slightly different but clearer field name (`log_directory_mode` is more descriptive than `log_dir_mode`).

## Implementation Steps

1. Mark task T009 as completed in TODO.md
2. Double check the codebase to ensure consistent usage of `log_directory_mode`
3. Ensure task T010 is updated if it refers to the field as `log_dir_mode`

## Conclusion

This task appears to already be completed as part of T008, but with a slightly different field name. The existing implementation meets all the requirements specified in T009.
