# Define Project Structure

## Implementation Approach
Create the necessary source files and directories as outlined in PLAN.md Section 4.3. This includes ensuring that `src/` directory exists and creating placeholder files for `config.rs`, `proxy_handler.rs`, and `logger.rs`. The `main.rs` file already exists but may need basic module declarations.
