# Build Test reqwest::Client - Plan

## Task Title
Build Test `reqwest::Client` in `setup_test_environment`

## Implementation Approach
Modify the `setup_test_environment` function in `tests/common/mod.rs` to create a `reqwest::Client` instance using the `Client::builder()` method. Configure the client with appropriate timeouts for testing, including connect and request timeouts. This will create an HTTP client suitable for use in test environments without waiting too long for responses.
