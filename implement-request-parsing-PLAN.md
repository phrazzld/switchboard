# Implement Request Parsing

## Implementation Approach
Extend the proxy_handler function in proxy_handler.rs to extract and process the incoming request details. This includes extracting the request method, URI, headers, and body, then handling any errors that might occur during the process. The implementation will record key request details in the tracing span for observability, and return appropriate error responses if body extraction fails. Initial steps will include removing the '_' prefix from function parameters to use them, cloning and storing essential request information, and implementing axum::body::to_bytes to read the request body with proper error handling.
