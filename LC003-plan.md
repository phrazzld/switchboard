# LC003: Update remaining hardcoded log paths in tests (COMPLETED)

## Task Description
Update test files that may still use hardcoded log paths to use the `LogPathResolver` consistently.

## Approach

1. **Identify affected files**: 
   - Search for hardcoded log paths in test files
   - Look for patterns like `.log`, direct path construction, etc.

2. **Analyze current LogPathResolver usage**:
   - Examine how LogPathResolver is currently used in the codebase
   - Ensure consistent approach across all test files

3. **Update each identified test**:
   - Replace hardcoded paths with LogPathResolver
   - Ensure test setup and teardown use correct paths
   - Verify tests continue to pass after changes

4. **Verification**:
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - Check if logs are correctly placed in the new structure
   - Verify no orphaned log files are created

## Implementation Steps

1. Search for test files using direct path construction for log files
2. For each affected file:
   - Update import statements to include LogPathResolver
   - Replace hardcoded paths with resolver usage
   - Adjust test setup/teardown code as needed
3. Run tests to verify functionality
4. Clean up any remaining issues

## Completed Changes

1. Updated `tests/logger_file_test.rs` to use generate_test_log_path instead of hardcoded paths
2. Updated `tests/logger_directory_test.rs` to use generate_test_log_path instead of hardcoded paths
3. Updated `tests/logger_stdout_test.rs` to use a better approach for generating test log paths
4. Updated `tests/logger_level_test.rs` to use generate_test_log_path instead of hardcoded paths
5. Updated `tests/test_log_utilities_test.rs` to use generate_test_log_path consistently
6. Updated `tests/common/mod.rs` verify_log_directory function to use LogPathResolver correctly
7. Cleaned up unused imports and fixed parameter types
8. Verified all tests pass after the changes
