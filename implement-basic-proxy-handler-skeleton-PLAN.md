# Implement Basic Proxy Handler Skeleton

## Implementation Approach
Create the `proxy_handler` async function signature in the proxy_handler.rs file with proper parameters (Request, Client, Config). Apply the `#[instrument]` macro with empty fields for request tracking, implement the initial setup by generating a UUID for the request ID, capturing the current tracing span, and recording the request ID in the span. Add a start time using `Instant::now()` for later duration calculation. This skeleton will serve as the foundation for the request handling implementation.
