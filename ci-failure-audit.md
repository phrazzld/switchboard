# CI Failure Audit

## Overview
The CI build for PR #3 "Enhanced Pre-commit Hooks" failed in the "Run Tests" job. The other jobs (Build Verification, Format Check, and Lint Check) passed successfully.

## Failure Details

### Failed Job: Run Tests
- **Command that failed**: `cargo test --all-features`
- **Exit Code**: 101
- **Time**: 36s

### Root Cause
The test failure is due to an intentionally failing test that was added during the manual testing of the pre-commit hook but was not removed before creating the pull request.

**Specific failure**:
```
running 1 test
test temp_test::intentionally_failing_test ... FAILED

failures:

---- temp_test::intentionally_failing_test stdout ----

thread 'temp_test::intentionally_failing_test' panicked at src/lib.rs:13:9:
assertion `left == right` failed: This test is designed to fail
  left: 1
 right: 2
```

The test was added as part of ticket T012 to verify that the pre-commit hook correctly detects failing tests. However, this test was intentionally designed to fail (it asserts that 1 equals 2), and it should have been removed after testing.

### File Location
The failing test is located in `src/lib.rs` at line 13, in a test module named `temp_test`.

## Fix Required
The solution is to remove the intentionally failing test from `src/lib.rs`. We need to:

1. Check out the branch
2. Remove the following test module from `src/lib.rs`:
   ```rust
   // Temporary test module for testing pre-commit hook failure detection
   #[cfg(test)]
   mod temp_test {
       #[test]
       fn intentionally_failing_test() {
           assert_eq!(1, 2, "This test is designed to fail");
       }
   }
   ```
3. Commit the change
4. Push to the branch

## Lessons Learned
1. **Cleanup Test Files**: Always remove any temporary test files or intentionally failing tests after manual testing is complete.

2. **Local CI Verification**: Before creating a pull request, run a full test suite locally to catch any issues.

3. **Pre-Push Check**: Consider adding a pre-push hook in addition to the pre-commit hook to catch issues that might arise from multiple commits.

4. **Testing Approach Refinement**: When testing failure scenarios, consider using a more isolated approach that doesn't affect the main codebase, such as temporary branches or separate test projects.
