# C001 Clarification Task: Strategy for handling Result<Config, ConfigError> with static config initialization

## Original Clarification Issue
- **C001 Â· Issue:** Determine strategy for handling `Result<Config, ConfigError>` with potential static config initialization.
- **Context:** PLAN.md > cr-01 > Steps > 3 (note about adjusting static init)
- **Blocking?:** yes (Blocks T012 implementation detail)

## Task Description
We need to determine the best approach for changing the `load_config` function signature from returning `Config` to returning `Result<Config, ConfigError>` while maintaining compatibility with any code that might be using a static configuration initialization pattern.

The current implementation likely has `load_config()` return a `Config` directly, which is then potentially stored in a static variable for global access. When we modify this to return a `Result<Config, ConfigError>` for better error handling, we need a strategy for handling this Result at the global/static initialization level.

## Implementation Requirements

1. Replace the current panic-based error handling in configuration loading with a more graceful Result-based approach.
2. Determine how to handle the Result when initializing any static/global Config instance.
3. Ensure a clean API for accessing configuration throughout the codebase.
4. Maintain good error messages and ensure they're properly logged.
5. Follow Rust best practices for error handling and static initialization.

## Relevant Information

From PLAN.md:
> Change the signature of `load_config` to `pub fn load_config() -> Result<Config, ConfigError>`. (Note: This might require adjusting how/when a static `Config` is initialized, potentially loading in `main` first).

> In `src/main.rs`, call `config::load_config()`. Match on the `Result`:
> - `Ok(config)`: Proceed with application startup (potentially initializing a `static OnceLock<Config>` or passing the config down).
> - `Err(e)`: Log the specific error using `tracing::error!` and exit the process gracefully with a non-zero status code (`std::process::exit(1)`).

This indicates we need to consider using a pattern like `static OnceLock<Config>` or another approach to manage global configuration state.

## Specific Questions to Answer

1. What is the best pattern for handling a Result return type when initializing static configuration in Rust?
2. Should we use `OnceLock`, `OnceCell`, `lazy_static`, or another approach for static configuration?
3. Where should the error handling occur - in `main.rs` or within the configuration module itself?
4. How should configuration be accessed throughout the codebase after this change?
5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches?

## Output Requirements

Please provide:
1. A clear recommendation for the strategy to adopt
2. Code examples showing the implementation approach
3. Explanation of why this approach is preferred over alternatives
4. Discussion of any potential trade-offs or considerations
