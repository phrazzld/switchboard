# SCOPE SPLITTING

Based on the scope analysis, split PLAN.md into multiple focused plan files.

## Source Plan
[See PLAN.md content]

## Scope Analysis Results
[See SCOPE-RESULT.md content]

## Output Requirements
1. Create separate plan files (PLAN-1.md, PLAN-2.md, etc.)
2. Each plan file must be independently implementable
3. Each must include a complete plan structure (introduction, context, approach, steps)
4. Each must maintain proper markdown formatting
5. Ensure all original content is preserved across the split plans
6. Add a "Dependency Notes" section to each plan if there are cross-dependencies
