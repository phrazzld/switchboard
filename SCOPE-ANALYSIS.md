# SCOPE ANALYSIS

Analyze the complexity and scope of PLAN.md and determine if it should be broken into multiple smaller plans.

## Context
- PLAN.md contains a detailed implementation plan for an OpenAI API Integration Adapter for the Switchboard proxy service.

## Scope Criteria
- Size: total steps, tasks, or changes required
- Cohesion: how tightly coupled the changes are
- Dependencies: number of interrelated components changed together
- Testing complexity: scope of testing required
- Review burden: how difficult this would be to meaningfully review
- Deployment risk: potential for regression or issues

## Analysis Instructions
1. Determine if PLAN.md should be split based on the scope criteria above
2. If splitting is recommended, identify logical boundaries for separation
3. Define clear, focused sub-plans with minimal interdependencies
4. Ensure each sub-plan is independently implementable and testable
