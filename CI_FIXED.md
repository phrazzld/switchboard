# CI Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Unused imports in src/logger.rs:**
   - Removed unused `std::process` import
   - Removed unused `std::process::Command` import
   - Added proper `#[cfg(target_family = "unix")]` annotations to imports that are only used on Unix platforms

2. **Clippy warning about manually implementing Default:**
   - Replaced manual `impl Default for CleanupResult` with `#[derive(Default)]` on the struct definition

3. **Dead code warnings:**
   - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations to:
     - `enum LogType` (specifically the `Test` variant)
     - `enum LogInitError` (unused variants)
     - `fn validate_log_path` function

4. **XDG acronym capitalization:**
   - Changed `LogDirectoryMode::XDG` to `LogDirectoryMode::Xdg` to comply with Rust naming conventions
   - Updated all references to this enum variant throughout the codebase

## Log Files Cleanup

- Removed all log files from the repository by deleting:
  - The `./logs` directory
  - Any stray log files in the root directory

All tests are now passing and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` runs successfully without errors.
