# Verify Streaming Response Processing

## Implementation Approach
Extend the `test_streaming_response_forward_success` test to process the streaming response body as a stream of chunks, verify each SSE event contains the expected content, and ensure the complete message is correctly assembled. This will be implemented by converting the response body into a stream, consuming it chunk by chunk, and validating each part against expected SSE event patterns.
