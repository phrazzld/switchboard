# Add Dev Dependencies to Cargo.toml - Plan

## Task Title
Add Dev Dependencies to `Cargo.toml`

## Implementation Approach
Add a `[dev-dependencies]` section to the Cargo.toml file and include the specified testing crates (tokio, wiremock, serde_json, axum, tower, http-body-util, and uuid) with the appropriate features. Ensure tokio features align with main dependencies and include rt-multi-thread to support async test execution.
