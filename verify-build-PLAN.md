## Task Description
Verify that the Switchboard project builds successfully in both development and release modes.

1. Run `cargo build` to verify a development build completes successfully
2. Run `cargo build --release` to verify a production build completes successfully
3. Run `cargo clippy` to ensure the code passes linting checks
4. Check for any build errors or warnings
5. Document the build results
