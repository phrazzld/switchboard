# T012 - Manual Testing Results

## Testing Summary

I manually tested the pre-commit hook to verify its behavior in various failure scenarios. Here are the results:

### 1. Formatting Error Test
- Created a test file with deliberate formatting errors
- The pre-commit hook successfully caught the formatting errors
- The commit was blocked as expected with a clear error message
- Conclusion: **PASSED** ✅

### 2. Clippy Error Test
- Created test files with deliberate clippy warnings
- The pre-commit hook did not detect these errors
- Possible cause: The clippy check may not be including all files, or the specific errors chosen were not triggering clippy
- Conclusion: **INCONCLUSIVE** ⚠️

### 3. Test Failure Test
- Created a test file with a deliberately failing test
- The pre-commit hook did not detect the failing test
- Possible causes:
  - The test might not be discovered properly by the test runner
  - The test runner might not be configured to fail the commit on test failures
  - The hook might not be capturing the test runner's exit code correctly
- Conclusion: **INCONCLUSIVE** ⚠️

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, I recommend the following:

1. For the formatting check: No changes needed, as it's working correctly.

2. For the clippy check: 
   - Review how clippy is configured in the pre-commit hook
   - Ensure it's checking all relevant files including test files
   - Consider adding specific flags to catch more linting issues

3. For the test failure check:
   - Review how tests are executed in the pre-commit hook
   - Ensure the hook correctly captures and checks the exit code from tests
   - Consider adding specific test flags to ensure all tests are executed

## Next Steps

Since the formatting check is working correctly, but the other checks yielded inconclusive results, this task is partially complete. Further investigation may be needed to fully verify the pre-commit hook's behavior with clippy errors and test failures.

However, we've confirmed that at least the formatting part of the hook is working as expected, which is a critical part of the quality checks.
