# T011 Plan - Document new log configuration options

## Overview

Task T011 requires documenting the new log configuration options that were implemented in T008, T009, and T010, specifically the `log_directory_mode` field and its associated environment variable `LOG_DIRECTORY_MODE`.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update README.md to include the new configuration options
2. Document the available values for `LOG_DIRECTORY_MODE` and explain their meanings
3. Ensure documentation is clear and consistent with the implementation

## Documentation Content Plan

The documentation should cover:
- The purpose of the `log_directory_mode` configuration
- The available options (Default, XDG, System) and what each means
- How to set the configuration through environment variables
- Default behavior if the configuration is not explicitly set

I'll add this to the appropriate section of README.md.
