# Integrate wiremock::MockServer Startup - Plan

## Task Title
Integrate `wiremock::MockServer` Startup into `setup_test_environment`

## Implementation Approach
Modify the `setup_test_environment` function in `tests/common/mod.rs` to initialize a `wiremock::MockServer` instance using the async `MockServer::start().await` method. Replace the `unimplemented!()` placeholder with a proper implementation that starts the mock server and stores it for later use in tests.
