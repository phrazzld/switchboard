# T014 Implementation Plan: Update main.rs to handle load_config result gracefully

## Task Description
From TODO.md:
```
- [~] **T014 · Refactor · P1: update main.rs to handle load_config result gracefully**
    - **Context:** PLAN.md > cr-01 > Steps > 5
    - **Action:**
        1. Modify `src/main.rs` where `load_config` (or its static accessor) is called.
        2. Match on the `Result<Config, ConfigError>`.
        3. On `Ok(config)`, proceed with application startup.
        4. On `Err(e)`, log the specific error via `tracing::error!` and call `std::process::exit(1)`.
    - **Done‑when:**
        1. `main.rs` handles both `Ok` and `Err` from config loading.
        2. Application exits with status 1 on configuration error, logging the specific error.
        3. `cargo run` with invalid config exits gracefully (no panic trace).
    - **Verification:**
        1. Run application with `OPENAI_ENABLED=true` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset.
        2. Verify specific error log message (e.g., "OpenAI integration enabled but OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set") and exit code 1.
    - **Depends‑on:** [T013]
```

## Task Classification
This task appears to be **already implemented**. After examining the current code in `src/main.rs`, I can see that proper error handling for the `load_config` function already exists. The code includes:

1. A match statement on the `Result<Config, ConfigError>` returned by `load_config`
2. Proper handling of the `Ok(cfg)` case with global config initialization
3. Proper handling of the `Err(e)` case with error printing and process exit with code 1

## Implementation Plan

Since the code is already properly implemented, the plan is to:

1. Verify that the current implementation meets all requirements
2. Check if there are any improvements that could be made
3. Verify the error handling by testing with an invalid configuration
4. Update the TODO.md file to mark the task as complete

## Verification
The main verification will be to test with an invalid configuration:
- Run the application with `OPENAI_ENABLED=true` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset
- Verify the expected error message is shown
- Verify the application exits with status code 1
