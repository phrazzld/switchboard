# CI Failures Analysis

## Failed Jobs

1. **Log Files Check**
   - Failure: The CI detected log files in the repository that shouldn't be committed
   - Error: `Process completed with exit code 1`

2. **Lint Check**
   - Failure: Clippy detected code issues
   - Error: `Process completed with exit code 101`

## Detailed Analysis

### Log Files Check Failure

The log check detected log files in the repository. This aligns with one of the code review concerns about redundant patterns in `.gitignore`. We need to ensure all log files are properly ignored.

**Required Action:**
- Check for any log files that might be in the repository
- Update `.gitignore` patterns to properly exclude all log files
- Ensure log files from tests are being properly cleaned up

### Lint Check Failure

Three linting issues were found:

1. **Unused imports in `src/logger.rs`:**
   ```rust
   use std::process;
   use std::process::Command;
   ```
   These imports are not being used and should be removed.

2. **Derivable implementation in `src/log_cleanup.rs`:**
   Current manual implementation:
   ```rust
   impl Default for CleanupResult {
       fn default() -> Self {
           CleanupResult {
               files_removed: 0,
               // ...
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   Should be replaced with:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Default)]
   pub struct CleanupResult {
       // ...
   }
   ```

## Action Plan

1. Remove unused imports from `src/logger.rs`
2. Replace manual `Default` implementation with `#[derive(Default)]` in `src/log_cleanup.rs`
3. Check for any log files in the repository and remove them
4. Update `.gitignore` to ensure all log files are properly excluded
5. Run tests locally to ensure all log files are properly cleaned up
