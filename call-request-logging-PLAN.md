# Call Request Logging

## Task
Call the `log_request_details` function from within the `proxy_handler` after parsing the request.

## Implementation Approach
1. Rename the `_original_headers` variable to `original_headers` to remove the leading underscore since we'll be using it
2. Call the `log_request_details` function after the request body has been successfully read, passing the method, original URI, headers, and body bytes as arguments
3. This will provide detailed request logging including headers and body content for debugging purposes
