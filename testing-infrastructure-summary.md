# Testing Infrastructure Summary

## Accomplished Goals

We have successfully set up the foundational testing infrastructure for the Switchboard proxy project:

1. **Test Directory Structure**: Created standard Rust integration test directory structure with `tests/` and `tests/common/` directories.

2. **Development Dependencies**: Added the necessary testing dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:
   - tokio with macros and rt-multi-thread features for async testing
   - wiremock for mocking the external Anthropic API
   - serde_json for JSON handling
   - axum for working with the web framework
   - tower with util feature for oneshot testing
   - http-body-util for handling HTTP response bodies
   - uuid for potential test data generation

3. **Shared Test Utilities**: Established a common module in `tests/common/mod.rs` with:
   - `TestSetup` struct containing all components needed for testing
   - `setup_test_environment()` function that:
     - Starts a WireMock server instance
     - Creates a test-specific configuration pointing to the mock server
     - Builds a reqwest::Client with appropriate timeouts
     - Instantiates an axum::Router for testing

4. **Basic Integration Test**: Created a functioning integration test in `tests/proxy_integration_tests.rs` that:
   - Sets up the test environment
   - Configures a mock expectation for Anthropic API responses
   - Sends a test request through the proxy
   - Verifies the response status and content

5. **Library Configuration**: Updated the project structure to support integration testing by:
   - Adding a `[lib]` section to Cargo.toml
   - Creating src/lib.rs to expose necessary modules for testing

## Testing Approach

The implemented testing infrastructure follows the project's testing philosophy:

- **Integration Testing Focus**: Tests the application through its public HTTP interface
- **External Dependency Mocking**: Uses WireMock to mock only the external Anthropic API
- **No Internal Mocking**: Avoids mocking internal components, testing through the public interface
- **DRY Test Utilities**: Common setup logic is centralized in the `common` module
- **Complete Testing Chain**: Tests the full request-response cycle through the proxy handler

## Future Considerations

1. **Test Coverage Enhancement**:
   - Add tests for streaming responses
   - Add error handling tests
   - Test header forwarding behavior
   - Add edge case tests

2. **Implementation Improvements**:
   - Refine `Config` handling to avoid `Box::leak` (e.g., using `Arc<Config>`)
   - Add helper functions for common mock setups
   - Consider extracting test utilities for different scenarios

3. **CI Integration**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions for running tests on pull requests
   - Add test coverage reporting

This testing infrastructure provides a solid foundation for future test development and ensures that the proxy handler's behavior can be verified reliably.
