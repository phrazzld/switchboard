# Enforce clippy warnings as errors in CI lint job

## Implementation Approach
Modify the lint job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add the `-D warnings` flag to the `cargo clippy` command, ensuring that all clippy warnings are treated as errors in the CI pipeline. This will help enforce higher code quality standards as per `CODING_STANDARDS.md` Standards 1 (Maximize Language Strictness) and 7 (Mandatory Linting).
