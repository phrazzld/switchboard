# Integrate Handler with Router

## Task Description
Verify that the `create_router` function correctly integrates with the fully implemented `proxy_handler`.

## Implementation Approach
This is a simple verification task since our implementation already connects the router to the handler. We will:

1. Verify that the router defined in `src/proxy_handler.rs` correctly routes requests to the proxy_handler function
2. Verify that `src/main.rs` correctly calls `create_router` with the required parameters
3. Confirm this integration meets the acceptance criteria [AC1] and [AC2]

No code changes are required as the router is already correctly integrated with the handler.
