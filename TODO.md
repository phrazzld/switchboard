# TODO

## Implement Integration Tests for Streaming Responses

- [x] **Task Title:** Create Streaming Response Test Skeleton
    - **Action:** Create a new test function `test_streaming_response_forward_success` with the `#[tokio::test]` attribute in `tests/proxy_integration_tests.rs`. Use similar setup to the existing test, but prepare for testing streaming response handling.
    - **Depends On:** Basic integration test infrastructure (already complete)
    - **AC Ref:** Basic test structure

- [x] **Task Title:** Set Up Mock Server for Streaming Response
    - **Action:** In the streaming test, configure the WireMock server to respond with a streaming response (using appropriate content-type header like `text/event-stream` and configuring a chunked response body).
    - **Depends On:** Create Streaming Response Test Skeleton
    - **AC Ref:** Mock server configuration

- [x] **Task Title:** Send Request Expecting Streaming Response
    - **Action:** Create and send a request with streaming expectations (e.g., including a `stream: true` parameter in the request JSON, if required by the API).
    - **Depends On:** Set Up Mock Server for Streaming Response
    - **AC Ref:** Request sending

- [ ] **Task Title:** Verify Streaming Response Processing
    - **Action:** Extract and process the streaming response, verifying that each chunk is correctly handled and the overall response maintains the expected streaming behavior.
    - **Depends On:** Send Request Expecting Streaming Response
    - **AC Ref:** Response validation

## âœ… TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP COMPLETE

All tasks for setting up the basic testing infrastructure have been completed successfully:

1. Created test directory structure
2. Added necessary dev dependencies to Cargo.toml
3. Set up TestSetup struct in common module
4. Implemented setup_test_environment function
5. Created first integration test with wiremock setup
6. Verified test passes successfully

## [!] CLARIFICATIONS / ASSUMPTIONS CONFIRMED

- [x] **Issue/Assumption:** Assumed `switchboard::proxy_handler::create_router` function exists and accepts `reqwest::Client` and `&'static Config` as arguments.
    - **Status:** Confirmed working in the implementation.

- [x] **Issue/Assumption:** Acknowledged use of `Box::leak` for passing `Config` to `create_router` in tests is a temporary simplification as noted in PLAN.md Step 3 Self-Correction.
    - **Status:** Implemented as planned. Future refinement to consider using `Arc<Config>` remains an option.

- [x] **Issue/Assumption:** Assumed project root directory is named `switchboard`.
    - **Status:** Confirmed correct in implementation.

- [x] **Issue/Assumption:** Assumed the specified dev-dependency versions in PLAN.md Step 2 are compatible with the project's current Rust toolchain version.
    - **Status:** Verified working with current setup.
