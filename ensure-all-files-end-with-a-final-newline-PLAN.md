# Ensure all files end with a final newline

## Implementation Approach
Verify and add a final newline character to the end of the files specified in the task: `README.md`, `hooks/pre-commit`, and `tests/common/mod.rs`. This ensures consistency with general programming best practices and helps prevent issues with text processing tools that expect files to end with a newline.
