# Remove Redundant Debug Logs for Body Logging

## Implementation Approach
Remove the redundant debug log messages in `src/proxy_handler.rs` (around lines 200-204 and 471-475) that explicitly state "Full request/response details logged (verbose mode enabled)". These messages are unnecessary since the actual body content logs (now at the DEBUG level) already indicate that logging occurred.
