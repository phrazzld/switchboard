# Verify Run

## Task Description
Verify that the Switchboard application runs correctly with the necessary environment variables set.

## Implementation Approach
1. Create a test environment with required environment variables:
   - `PORT`: Set to a test port like 8080
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Use a placeholder value for testing
   - `LOG_LEVEL`: Set to "info" for standard logging
   - `LOG_FORMAT`: Set to "pretty" for readable console output

2. Run the application using `cargo run`

3. Verify the application:
   - Check that the application starts up without errors
   - Verify that it displays the expected startup logs
   - Confirm that it binds to the specified port
   - Verify that configuration values are loaded correctly

4. Document the test results
