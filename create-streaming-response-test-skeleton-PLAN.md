# Create Streaming Response Test Skeleton

## Implementation Approach
Create a new test function `test_streaming_response_forward_success` in `tests/proxy_integration_tests.rs` with the same basic structure as the existing test, but with appropriate comments and setup focusing on testing streaming response processing. Reuse the `setup_test_environment()` function for test environment setup.
