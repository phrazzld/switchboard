# T014 - Manual Testing Results for No Rust Files Scenario

## Testing Summary

I manually tested the pre-commit hook to verify its behavior when no Rust files are staged. Here are the results:

### Test Scenario #1: Committing Only Non-Rust Files

**Test Steps:**
1. Created a non-Rust file (`tests/non_rust_test.md`)
2. Staged only this file
3. Attempted to commit

**Expected Behavior:**
- The pre-commit hook should detect that no Rust files are staged
- Rust-specific checks (line count, cargo fmt, cargo clippy, cargo test) should be skipped
- The commit should proceed without errors

**Actual Behavior:**
- The pre-commit hook displayed the message "Running pre-commit checks..."
- No Rust-specific checks were run
- The hook displayed "All checks passed!"
- The commit was successful

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - The pre-commit hook correctly handled the scenario with only non-Rust files.

### Test Scenario #2: Empty Commit

**Test Steps:**
1. Used `git commit --allow-empty` to create an empty commit
2. Observed the behavior of the pre-commit hook

**Expected Behavior:**
- The pre-commit hook should handle the empty commit gracefully
- No Rust-specific checks should be run
- The commit should be allowed

**Actual Behavior:**
- The pre-commit hook displayed the message "Running pre-commit checks..."
- No Rust-specific checks were run
- The hook displayed "All checks passed!"
- The empty commit was successful

**Result:** ✅ PASSED - The pre-commit hook correctly handled the empty commit scenario.

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hook successfully handles cases where no Rust files are staged:
1. It properly skips Rust-specific checks when only non-Rust files are committed
2. It gracefully handles empty commits

The implementation of the `if [ -n "$STAGED_RS_FILES" ]; then ... else ... fi` conditional structure effectively ensures that Rust-specific checks only run when they're relevant, improving the efficiency and user experience of the hook.
