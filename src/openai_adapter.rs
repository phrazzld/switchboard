//! OpenAI API integration adapter for Switchboard
//!
//! This module provides an adapter that handles:
//! - Translating Switchboard requests to OpenAI API format
//! - Forwarding requests to the OpenAI API
//! - Mapping OpenAI API responses back to the expected Switchboard format
//! - Error handling and translation
//!
//! The adapter is structured to support both streaming and non-streaming responses
//! while maintaining a consistent interface for the main proxy handler.

// Module will be implemented in future tasks
