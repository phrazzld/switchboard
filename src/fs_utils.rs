//! Filesystem utilities for directory management and permissions
//!
//! This module provides cross-platform abstractions for common filesystem
//! operations needed by the application, including:
//!
//! - Creating directories with proper permissions
//! - Checking if directories are writable
//!
//! Functions handle platform-specific behavior (Unix vs Windows) where relevant,
//! particularly for permission management.

// Functions to be implemented in later tasks:
// - ensure_directory
// - check_writable
