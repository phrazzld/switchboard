# Implement Streaming Response Detection

## Task Title
Implement Streaming Response Detection: Check the Content-Type header of the upstream response for text/event-stream.

## Brief Implementation Approach
Verify if the response is a streaming response by checking if the Content-Type header contains "text/event-stream" in the proxy_handler function after receiving the response from the Anthropic API.

## Observations
Upon checking the codebase, a streaming response detection is already implemented in the proxy_handler function (lines 284-287). The implementation correctly checks the Content-Type header for "text/event-stream", which is consistent with Server-Sent Events (SSE) that Anthropic uses for streaming responses.

The existing implementation:
1. Gets the Content-Type header from the response headers
2. Safely converts it to a string
3. Checks if it contains "text/event-stream"
4. Defaults to non-streaming if header is missing or invalid
5. Sets an is_streaming boolean flag for conditional logic

This implementation meets the requirements for the task.
