# OpenAI API Integration Adapter - Implementation Plans

This is an index of the implementation plans for the OpenAI API Integration Adapter feature, which has been split into smaller, focused sub-plans for better manageability, review, and implementation.

## Plan Structure

The original plan has been decomposed into four sequential sub-plans:

1. **[PLAN-1.md](./PLAN-1.md): Foundation - OpenAI Configuration & Dependencies**
   - Sets up configuration variables, adds dependencies, and prepares project structure
   - No dependencies on other plans

2. **[PLAN-2.md](./PLAN-2.md): Core Logic - OpenAI Adapter Module & Unit Tests**
   - Implements the core OpenAI adapter logic with request/response mapping and unit tests
   - Depends on PLAN-1 (configuration and dependencies)

3. **[PLAN-3.md](./PLAN-3.md): Integration - Connect Adapter to Proxy Handler**
   - Integrates the OpenAI adapter into the main request handling flow
   - Depends on PLAN-2 (adapter implementation)

4. **[PLAN-4.md](./PLAN-4.md): Validation - Integration Testing & Documentation**
   - Implements integration tests with API mocking and finalizes documentation
   - Depends on PLAN-3 (integration with proxy handler)

## Implementation Sequence

These plans should be implemented in numerical order (1-4) as each builds upon the previous one. Each plan results in a separate, focused PR that can be reviewed and merged independently.

## Reference

The original, unsplit plan is preserved as [PLAN-ORIGINAL.md](./PLAN-ORIGINAL.md) for reference.
