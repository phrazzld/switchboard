# T009 - Colored Output Implementation Status

## Assessment Summary

After examining the pre-commit hook, I found that colored output is already fully implemented:

### Existing Implementation

1. **Color Variables Defined**: The pre-commit hook already defines the following color variables:
   ```bash
   # Store the colors
   RED='\033[0;31m'
   GREEN='\033[0;32m'
   YELLOW='\033[0;33m'
   NC='\033[0m' # No Color
   ```

2. **Color Usage**: These color variables are consistently used throughout the script:
   - YELLOW: For informational messages (e.g., "Running pre-commit checks...")
   - GREEN: For success messages (e.g., "All checks passed!")
   - RED: For error messages (e.g., "Error: Formatting check failed.")
   - NC: To reset the color after each colored message

3. **Consistent Pattern**: The script follows a consistent pattern for colored output:
   ```bash
   echo "${COLOR}Message...${NC}"
   ```

### Status

The colored output functionality is already fully implemented and working correctly. All of the requirements for T009 have been met:

1. ✅ Standard ANSI color code variables (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, NC) are defined
2. ✅ Colors are applied to summary messages
3. ✅ Colors are applied to warnings and errors

No further changes are needed for this task.
